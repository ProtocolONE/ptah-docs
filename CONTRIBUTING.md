### Report bugs

Report bugs and issues by submitting a [bug report](../../issues/new?labels=type%3A+bug&template=bug_report.md). Make sure that you provide as much information as possible on how to reproduce the bug.

### Feature Requests and support

Chances are, you like what we have already but you may require a custom integration, a special license or something else big and specific to your needs that our community may not benefit from. We're generally open to such conversations.

### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

At this very moment, we're working on the CLA. Until it is ready we may be on the slower side in accepting your contributions.
