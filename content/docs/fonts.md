# Typography
***

The landing page design must be on-brand. It's recommended to use from 1 to 3 typefaces. 
If you have more than 3 typefaces it can make your page chaotic. 

Once you have chosen the right typeface, typography makes your landing page appealing and readable.

## Set up fonts
***

Ptah has a built-in Google Fonts library which offers about 1000 fonts to choose from for all your text and button needs.
