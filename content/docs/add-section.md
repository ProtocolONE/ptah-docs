# Create a section
***

Ptah builder lets you construct landing pages for games using a series of sections which contain different web-elements.
On the left panel you can select desired sections and their properties.
After you make a change the preview area will update and you can edit a content of the inserted section.

Each section is designed to emphasize a different aspect of your game.

You can build your page from a wide range of pre-designed sections:

    Header
    Footer

    и т.д.
