# How to create especially effective page?
***

You can create your entire website with a drag-and-drop builder and also include custom HTML and CSS. 
Ptah will enable you to visually customize every single aspect of your website.

## Purposes to have a game landing

- Link to game publishing platforms like Steam
- Showcase your game's trailer, features, and screenshots
- Capture newsletter subscribers
- Link to your social media accounts
- Host your press kit
- Community forums
- Pre-order page

## Establish branding

- Logo

With respect to your game's logo, you'll need three versions: text-only, one that features only the icon, and one that combines the two. You'll use these not only for your website, but for everything from social media avatars to press kit resources and other marketing materials.

Your logos should all come in a dark and light variation. Use the dark version on bright backgrounds, and the light version on dark backgrounds.

All versions of your logo should also come in two formats: high-resolution raster (.png) and vector format (.eps, .ai, or .svg).

- Fonts

Head over to Google Fonts or Fontpair and pick a decent combination that reflects the style and tone of your game.

- Color palette

You can pick up to five colors and toggle alternate shades with the click of a button.

At the very minimum, you'll need one color that you can use for calls-to-action such as buttons and links. To maintain consistent branding, I'd recommend choosing this color from your game (e.g., your in-game user interface color).

You can take advantage of Ptah Settings to generate a color palette from game screenshots.

## The simple and perfect structure

Detailed instructions on how to create content for each section:

### Header

First of all, notice that there’s no navigation, and very few outgoing links overall. This is an attempt to remove all distraction from your primary goal. The last thing we want is to get players ready to buy, have them click away somewhere else, lose that desire, and never come back. 

All we really need up top is the one-liner that makes them want to click the “buy now” button, and the button itself.

### Call-to-Action

The top section of your website (a.k.a. "above the fold") is the first thing visitors will see, so it's crucial that it immediately captures their attention.

After all, 55% of of them will spend less than 15 seconds on your website.

The main purpose of this section is to act as a call-to-action, funneling traffic to a crowdfunding page or upcoming store page; collecting email addresses in case you haven't yet launched your game; and sending visitors to distribution platforms like Steam or your own shop after you've launched.

### Video

If a game screenshot is worth a thousand words, a game trailer could very well be worth a thousand downloads.

There are two ways to feature your trailer on your homepage: as an embed, or as a play button that will trigger a video popup. Whichever option you choose, it's a smart idea to place your trailer in the first or second section of your website.

### Features

Quick tip: when writing about your game's features, there's no need to write long chucks of text—a short paragraph or sentence will do the job.

You don't have to list every single feature; just focus on 3-6 of the most enticing ones.

### Gallery

Make sure that your screenshots are sized at least full HD (1920x1080 pixels), but 4k is better. If your game features complex HUD elements, remember to remove them when taking screenshots.

### Reviews & Awards

Influencer endorsement is one of the most effective ways to increase your game sales, but getting well-known journalists and streamers to review your game might be hard, especially if you're a lone-wolf developer or a new/small indie studio.

### Footer

The purpose of your website's footer is to act as a safety net to catch visitors before they hit the bottom of the page.

It's your last chance to convert visitors into buyers and email subscribers—and a place where you can include helpful links, like those to your press kit or social media accounts.

# Design optimization

## Contrasting CTA button

Call-to-action (CTA) buttons are the buttons you use in your website and on your landing pages to guide users towards your goal conversion.

CTA buttons have a very specific goal: to get your web visitor clicking and completing a conversion.

## Post-click experience
A post-click landing page is a standalone web page, disconnected from a website’s navigation, created for the sole purpose of convincing a visitor to act (to sign up, buy, download, etc.). 
As businesses become more data-driven, post-click landing pages become more popular for their ability to deliver high ROI. Research has shown that companies using 40 or more post-click landing pages generate 120% more leads than those using less than 5.
