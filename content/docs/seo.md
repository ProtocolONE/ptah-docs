## The SEO-Friendly URL Structure
***

### Choose the right domain name
***

First of all, the domain name must be easy-to-read and brandable. 

Moreover, search engines look at the domain to understand what your site is about and to decide how to rank it. 
For this reason, keywords that are relevant to your game should appear somewhere in the URL.

**For example:**
Your company name is WonderWorld, thus the domain for a game can be like wonderworldgames.com.

### Set up the secure protocol HTTPS
***

Start using HTTPS because this protocol uses an SSL certificate to move data. It gives your users peace of mind when sharing potentially sensitive data on a website.

Moreover, at the Chrome browser’s alerting system looks more reliable for user if the website uses HTTPS protocol:

### Keep reader-friendly URLs
***

- **Keep URL short**

A well-designed URL provides a reader-friendly link for humans and an easy-to-understand link for search engines. 
More than that, do not use too many similar words in a URL to avoid a keyword stuffing if you.

- **Use hyphens to separate words in URL**

Google recommends using hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_) in your URLs.

- **Use lowercase letters in URL**

Search engines can decrypt from uppercase and lowercase letters in URLs, which can lead to duplicate URLs and loss of page rank.

## The essential meta data
***

### Create Title Tag
***

The meta title and description mean that you can tell for a search engine exactly what you're talking about to categorize and understand your web page.
Remember, title appears in search engines and the Web browser’s title bar.

TODO EXAMPLE CODE, TODO SERP IMAGE

{{< hint >}}
To add a title, click the Settings icon on the top menu. Choose the SEO tab to enter a title text and click Save.
{{< /hint >}}

- **The recommended format for the title is: Primary Keyword – Secondary Keyword | Brand**

The primary keyword must be unique to that page in that there is only one page dedicated to that primary keyword.

**For example:**
Mobile endless runner – Wild Fastest Animals | WonderWorld

- **Use only one Title Tag and one H1 Header on the web page**

Include the page’s primary keyword in both tags. Each page title should be absolutely unique.

- **Keep your title under 60 characters**

It's not a character limit, but you can take into account, that the title length in search results depends on the display width.

### Create meta description
***

The meta description provides a summary of a web page. Search engines such often display the meta description in search results.

**For example:**
TODO EXAMPLE CODE, TODO SERP IMAGE

- **Use your keywords at the beginning at the description**

Note, search engines bold keywords in the description when they match search queries. 
You should match your descriptions to search terms as closely as possible.

- **Keep your description under 160 characters**

It's not a character limit, but you can take into account, that the description length depends on the display width, search engine and others.

- **Don't include double quotation marks**

It's recommended to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from meta descriptions to prevent removing the description from search results.

- **Each page descriptions should be absolutely unique**

### Define a favicon to show in search results

That's why, the uploaded favicon leads to the brand recognition in search results.
