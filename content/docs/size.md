# Spacing on the page
***

You can create extra space around elements to help your users focus on the content, what may increases conversions.

{{< figure src="/images/spacing1.png">}}

The best practice is spacing and sizing within ratios. Ptah pre-designed sections keep spacing consistent. 
This is how one of Ptah sections with default spacing looks like: 

{{< figure src="/images/spacing2.png">}}

Any element on your page can have spacing that immediately surrounds the element within the border (padding) and outside the border (margin).

{{< figure src="/images/spacing3.png">}}

You can customise the padding and margin of any element.

You can update indents for an element right on Settings Panel after selecting the element on Preview Area.

To update the block indents, hover over the block and click the *Settings icon* at the top-left corner.

To open the sections Indents Setting, click the *Spacing icon* at the end of the section's title in Sections Menu.

The spacing settings allows you to set the top, bottom, left and right margin and padding of an element. 

To make all margin or padding values equal, click the *Chain icon* and set just one of the value and the others will get the same value automatically.

## Size settings and units
***

### Section size
***

The section's width is set to full screen automatically on every device.

You can adjust the section height:

{{< figure src="/images/spacing4.png">}}

- **Auto**
    
    The section's height is set automatically depending on the default indents and its elements sizes.
    
- **Viewport Height**
    
    You can specify the height in relative terms using viewport-height (vh) 
    where 1 vh is equivalent to 1% of the height of the browser window.
    
- **Pixels**
    
    You can specify the height in absolute terms using pixel values (px).

### Make a full-screen section
***

You can use a powerful visual effect to make a full-screen version of the page: set the height of every section to fit the whole height of the browser window and replace scrolling with slider controls.

{{< figure src="/images/slides.png">}}

{{< hint >}}
To set up a full screen version, go *Page Style* > *Background* and turn on the *Full page scroll* option.
{{< /hint >}}

### Text
***

[Set up the default text settings in Fonts](/docs/fonts-and-colors/).

To customise the text size, double-click on it and adjust the font size in pixels (px) in Settings Panel.
