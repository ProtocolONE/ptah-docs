### Header

A header is the top section of the web page, thus it's the first thing visitors see. 
The [fixed (sticky) header](/docs/add-section/#header) persists on all sections.

{{< hint info >}}
Tips for this section:

- Focus your customers on a single page, avoid navigation, menus and outgoing links
- A one-liner with your logo and a CTA (Call to Action) button
- The CTA button should have a clear, concise, and obvious offer (*Buy Now on Steam, View on GOG, Get started, Join to Download* and others).
- The CTA button should be designed in a contrasting color, easy to notice

To add a header to the page, choose from one of Ptah **Header** sections.
